<div class="mono">Neural network accelerators have been widely applied to edge devices for complex tasks like object tracking, image recognition, etc. Previous works have explored the quantization technologies in related lightweight accelerator designs to reduce hardware resource consumption. However, low precision leads to high accuracy loss in inference. Therefore, mixed-precision quantization becomes an alternative solution by applying different precision in different layers to trade off resource consumption and accuracy. Because regular designs for multiplication on hardware cannot support the precision reconfiguration for a multi-precision Quantized Neural Network (QNN) model in runtime, we propose a runtime reconfigurable multi-precision multi-channel bitwise systolic array design for QNN accelerators. We have implemented and evaluated our work on the Ultra96 FPGA platform. Results show that our work can achieve 1.3185 to 3.5671 times speedup in inferring mixed-precision models and has less critical path delay, supporting a higher clock frequency (250MHz).</div></details>

<div class="mono">Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models map multimodal perception and language instructions to executable robot actions, making them particularly vulnerable to behavioral backdoor manipulation: a hidden trigger introduced during training can induce unintended physical actions while nominal task performance remains intact. Prior work on VLA backdoors primarily studies untargeted attacks or task-level hijacking, leaving fine-grained control over individual actions largely unexplored. In this work, we present DropVLA, an action-level backdoor attack that forces a reusable action primitive (e.g., open_gripper) to execute at attacker-chosen decision points under a realistic pipeline-black-box setting with limited data-poisoning access, using a window-consistent relabeling scheme for chunked fine-tuning. On OpenVLA-7B evaluated with LIBERO, vision-only poisoning achieves 98.67%-99.83% attack success rate (ASR) with only 0.31% poisoned episodes while preserving 98.50%-99.17% clean-task retention, and successfully triggers the targeted action within 25 control steps at 500 Hz (0.05 s). Text-only triggers are unstable at low poisoning budgets, and combining text with vision provides no consistent ASR improvement over vision-only attacks. The backdoor remains robust to moderate trigger variations and transfers across evaluation suites (96.27%, 99.09%), whereas text-only largely fails (0.72%). We further validate physical-world feasibility on a 7-DoF Franka arm with pi0-fast, demonstrating non-trivial attack efficacy under camera-relative motion that induces image-plane trigger drift. These results reveal that VLA models can be covertly steered at the granularity of safety-critical actions with minimal poisoning and without observable degradation of nominal performance.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Nonlinear Model Predictive Control (NMPC) is a powerful approach for controlling highly dynamic robotic systems, as it accounts for system dynamics and optimizes control inputs at each step. However, its high computational complexity makes implementation on resource-constrained microcontrollers impractical. While recent studies have demonstrated the feasibility of Model Predictive Control (MPC) with linearized dynamics on microcontrollers, applying full NMPC remains a significant challenge. This work presents an efficient solution for generating and deploying NMPC on microcontrollers (NMPCM) to control quadrotor UAVs. The proposed method optimizes computational efficiency while maintaining high control accuracy. Simulations in Gazebo/ROS and real-world experiments validate the effectiveness of the approach, demonstrating its capability to achieve high-frequency NMPC execution in real-time systems.

<div class="mono">Leader-follower interaction is an important paradigm in human-robot interaction (HRI). Yet, assigning roles in real time remains challenging for resource-constrained mobile and assistive robots. While large language models (LLMs) have shown promise for natural communication, their size and latency limit on-device deployment. Small language models (SLMs) offer a potential alternative, but their effectiveness for role classification in HRI has not been systematically evaluated. In this paper, we present a benchmark of SLMs for leader-follower communication, introducing a novel dataset derived from a published database and augmented with synthetic samples to capture interaction-specific dynamics. We investigate two adaptation strategies: prompt engineering and fine-tuning, studied under zero-shot and one-shot interaction modes, compared with an untrained baseline. Experiments with Qwen2.5-0.5B reveal that zero-shot fine-tuning achieves robust classification performance (86.66% accuracy) while maintaining low latency (22.2 ms per sample), significantly outperforming baseline and prompt-engineered approaches. However, results also indicate a performance degradation in one-shot modes, where increased context length challenges the model&#x27;s architectural capacity. These findings demonstrate that fine-tuned SLMs provide an effective solution for direct role assignment, while highlighting critical trade-offs between dialogue complexity and classification reliability on the edge.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Machine learning algorithms are being used more frequently in the first-level triggers in collider experiments, with Graph Neural Networks pushing the hardware requirements of FPGA-based triggers beyond the current state of the art. To meet the stringent demands of high-throughput and low-latency environments, we propose a concept for latency-optimized preprocessing of sparse sensor data, enabling efficient GNN hardware acceleration by removing dynamic input sparsity. Our approach rearranges data coming from a large number of First-In-First-Out interfaces, typically sensor frontends, to a smaller number of FIFO interfaces connected to a machine learning hardware accelerator. In order to achieve high throughput while minimizing the hardware utilization, we developed a hierarchical sparsity compression pipeline optimized for FPGAs. We implemented our concept in the Chisel design language as an open-source hardware generator. For demonstration, we implemented one configuration of our module as preprocessing stage in a GNN-based first-level trigger for the Electromagnetic Calorimeter inside the Belle II detector. Additionally we evaluate latency, throughput, resource utilization, and scalability for a wide range of parameters, to enable broader use for other large scale scientific experiments.</div></details>

<div class="mono">We present UniScale, a unified, scale-aware multi-view 3D reconstruction framework for robotic applications that flexibly integrates geometric priors through a modular, semantically informed design. In vision-based robotic navigation, the accurate extraction of environmental structure from raw image sequences is critical for downstream tasks. UniScale addresses this challenge with a single feed-forward network that jointly estimates camera intrinsics and extrinsics, scale-invariant depth and point maps, and the metric scale of a scene from multi-view images, while optionally incorporating auxiliary geometric priors when available. By combining global contextual reasoning with camera-aware feature representations, UniScale is able to recover the metric-scale of the scene. In robotic settings where camera intrinsics are known, they can be easily incorporated to improve performance, with additional gains obtained when camera poses are also available. This co-design enables robust, metric-aware 3D reconstruction within a single unified model. Importantly, UniScale does not require training from scratch, and leverages world priors exhibited in pre-existing models without geometric encoding strategies, making it particularly suitable for resource-constrained robotic teams. We evaluate UniScale on multiple benchmarks, demonstrating strong generalization and consistent performance across diverse environments. We will release our implementation upon acceptance.</div></details>

<details class="detail"><summary>Abstract</summary>
<div class="mono">Percutaneous dilatational tracheostomy (PDT) is frequently performed on patients in intensive care units for prolonged mechanical ventilation. The needle puncture, as the most critical step of PDT, could lead to adverse consequences such as major bleeding and posterior tracheal wall perforation if performed inaccurately. Current practices of PDT puncture are all performed manually with no navigation assistance, which leads to large position and angular errors (5 mm and 30 degree). To improve the accuracy and reduce the difficulty of the PDT procedure, we propose a system that automates the needle insertion using a velocity-controlled robotic manipulator. Guided using pose data from two electromagnetic sensors, one at the needle tip and the other inside the trachea, the robotic system uses an adaptive constrained controller to adapt the uncertain kinematic parameters online and avoid collisions with the patient&#x27;s body and tissues near the target. Simulations were performed to validate the controller&#x27;s implementation, and then four hundred PDT punctures were performed on a mannequin to evaluate the position and angular accuracy. The absolute median puncture position error was 1.7 mm (IQR: 1.9 mm) and midline deviation was 4.13 degree (IQR: 4.55 degree), measured by the sensor inside the trachea. The small deviations from the nominal puncture in a simulated experimental setup and formal guarantees of collision-free insertions suggest the feasibility of the robotic PDT puncture.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have shown remarkable success in robotic tasks like manipulation by fusing a language model&#x27;s reasoning with a vision model&#x27;s 3D understanding. However, their high computational cost remains a major obstacle for real-world applications that require real-time performance. We observe that the actions within a task have varying levels of importance: critical steps demand high precision, while less important ones can tolerate more variance. Leveraging this insight, we propose DySL-VLA, a novel framework that addresses computational cost by dynamically skipping VLA layers based on each action&#x27;s importance. DySL-VLA categorizes its layers into two types: informative layers, which are consistently executed, and incremental layers, which can be selectively skipped. To intelligently skip layers without sacrificing accuracy, we invent a prior-post skipping guidance mechanism to determine when to initiate layer-skipping. We also propose a skip-aware two-stage knowledge distillation algorithm to efficiently train a standard VLA into a DySL-VLA. Our experiments indicate that DySL-VLA achieves 2.1% improvement in success length over Deer-VLA on the Calvin dataset, while simultaneously reducing trainable parameters by a factor of 85.7 and providing a 3.75x speedup relative to the RoboFlamingo baseline at iso-accuracy.

<div class="mono">This paper focuses on enhancing the grasping precision and generalization of manipulation policies learned via imitation learning. Diffusion-based policy learning methods have recently become the mainstream approach for robotic manipulation tasks. As grasping is a critical subtask in manipulation, the ability of imitation-learned policies to execute precise and generalizable grasps merits particular attention. Existing imitation learning techniques for grasping often suffer from imprecise grasp executions, limited spatial generalization, and poor object generalization. To address these challenges, we incorporate grasp prior knowledge into the diffusion policy framework. In particular, we employ a latent diffusion policy to guide action chunk decoding with grasp pose prior, ensuring that generated motion trajectories adhere closely to feasible grasp configurations. Furthermore, we introduce a self-supervised reconstruction objective during diffusion to embed the graspness prior: at each reverse diffusion step, we reconstruct wrist-camera images back-projected the graspness from the intermediate representations. Both simulation and real robot experiments demonstrate that our approach significantly outperforms baseline methods and exhibits strong dynamic grasping capabilities.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Since local LLM inference on resource-constrained edge devices imposes a severe performance bottleneck, this paper proposes distributed prompt caching to enhance inference performance by cooperatively sharing intermediate processing states across multiple low-end edge devices. To fully utilize prompt similarity, our distributed caching mechanism also supports partial matching. As this approach introduces communication overhead associated with state sharing over a wireless network, we introduce a Bloom-filter-based data structure, referred to as a catalog, to determine whether a remote server possesses the desired internal states, thereby suppressing unnecessary communication. Experiments using the Gemma-3 270M model and the MMLU dataset on the Raspberry Pi Zero 2W platform demonstrate that the proposed approach reduces TTFT (Time to First Token) and TTLT (Time to Last Token) by 93.12% and 50.07% on average, respectively.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Autonomous exploration in unknown environments is key for mobile robots, helping them perceive, map, and make decisions in complex areas. However, current methods often rely on frequent global optimization, suffering from high computational latency and trajectory oscillation, especially on resource-constrained edge devices. To address these limitations, we propose SCOPE, a novel framework that incrementally constructs a real-time skeletal graph and introduces Implicit Unknown Region Analysis for efficient spatial reasoning. The planning layer adopts a hierarchical on-demand strategy: the Proximal Planner generates smooth, high-frequency local trajectories, while the Region-Sequence Planner is activated only when necessary to optimize global visitation order. Comparative evaluations in simulation demonstrate that SCOPE achieves competitive exploration performance comparable to state-of-the-art global planners, while reducing computational cost by an average of 86.9%. Real-world experiments further validate the system&#x27;s robustness and low latency in practical scenarios.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models have emerged as a generalist robotic agent. However, existing VLAs are hindered by excessive parameter scales, prohibitive pre-training requirements, and limited applicability to diverse embodiments. To improve the practicality of VLAs, we propose a comprehensive benchmark and an improved baseline. First, we propose CEBench, a new benchmark spanning diverse embodiments in both simulation and the real world with consideration of domain randomization. We collect 14.4k simulated trajectories and 1.6k real-world expert-curated trajectories to support training on CEBench. Second, using CEBench as our testbed, we study three critical aspects of VLAs&#x27; practicality and offer several key findings. Informed by these findings, we introduce LLaVA-VLA, a lightweight yet powerful VLA designed for practical deployment on consumer-grade GPUs. Architecturally, it integrates a compact VLM backbone with multi-view perception, proprioceptive tokenization, and action chunking. To eliminate reliance on costly pre-training, LLaVA-VLA adopts a two-stage training paradigm including post-training and fine-tuning. Furthermore, LLaVA-VLA extends the action space to unify navigation and manipulation. Experiments across embodiments demonstrate the capabilities of generalization and versatility of LLaVA-VLA , while real-world mobile manipulation experiments establish it as the first end-to-end VLA model for mobile manipulation. We will open-source all datasets, codes, and checkpoints upon acceptance to foster reproducibility and future research.</div></details>

<div class="mono">World model based planning has significantly improved decision-making in complex environments by enabling agents to simulate future states and make informed choices. This computational burden is particularly restrictive in robotics, where resources are severely constrained. To address this limitation, we propose a Sparse Imagination for Efficient Visual World Model Planning, which enhances computational efficiency by reducing the number of tokens processed during forward prediction. Our method leverages a sparsely trained vision-based world model based on transformers with randomized grouped attention strategy, allowing the model to flexibly adjust the number of tokens processed based on the computational resource. By enabling sparse imagination during latent rollout, our approach significantly accelerates planning while maintaining high control fidelity. Experimental results demonstrate that sparse imagination preserves task performance while dramatically improving inference efficiency. This general technique for visual planning is applicable from simple test-time trajectory optimization to complex real-world tasks with the latest VLAs, enabling the deployment of world models in real-time scenarios.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Generative retrieval has emerged as a powerful paradigm for LLM-based recommendation. However, industrial recommender systems often benefit from restricting the output space to a constrained subset of items based on business logic (e.g. enforcing content freshness or product category), which standard autoregressive decoding cannot natively support. Moreover, existing constrained decoding methods that make use of prefix trees (Tries) incur severe latency penalties on hardware accelerators (TPUs/GPUs). In this work, we introduce STATIC (Sparse Transition Matrix-Accelerated Trie Index for Constrained Decoding), an efficient and scalable constrained decoding technique designed specifically for high-throughput LLM-based generative retrieval on TPUs/GPUs. By flattening the prefix tree into a static Compressed Sparse Row (CSR) matrix, we transform irregular tree traversals into fully vectorized sparse matrix operations, unlocking massive efficiency gains on hardware accelerators. We deploy STATIC on a large-scale industrial video recommendation platform serving billions of users. STATIC produces significant product metric impact with minimal latency overhead (0.033 ms per step and 0.25% of inference time), achieving a 948x speedup over a CPU trie implementation and a 47-1033x speedup over a hardware-accelerated binary-search baseline. Furthermore, the runtime overhead of STATIC remains extremely low across a wide range of practical configurations. To the best of our knowledge, STATIC enables the first production-scale deployment of strictly constrained generative retrieval. In addition, evaluation on academic benchmarks demonstrates that STATIC can considerably improve cold-start performance for generative retrieval. Our code is available at https://github.com/youtube/static-constraint-decoding.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Articulated object pose estimation is a core task in embodied AI. Existing methods typically regress poses in a continuous space, but often struggle with 1) navigating a large, complex search space and 2) failing to incorporate intrinsic kinematic constraints. In this work, we introduce DICArt (DIsCrete Diffusion for Articulation Pose Estimation), a novel framework that formulates pose estimation as a conditional discrete diffusion process. Instead of operating in a continuous domain, DICArt progressively denoises a noisy pose representation through a learned reverse diffusion procedure to recover the GT pose. To improve modeling fidelity, we propose a flexible flow decider that dynamically determines whether each token should be denoised or reset, effectively balancing the real and noise distributions during diffusion. Additionally, we incorporate a hierarchical kinematic coupling strategy, estimating the pose of each rigid part hierarchically to respect the object&#x27;s kinematic structure. We validate DICArt on both synthetic and real-world datasets. Experimental results demonstrate its superior performance and robustness. By integrating discrete generative modeling with structural priors, DICArt offers a new paradigm for reliable category-level 6D pose estimation in complex environments.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are multimodal robotic task controllers that, given an instruction and visual inputs, produce a sequence of low-level control actions (or motor commands) enabling a robot to execute the requested task in the physical environment. These systems face the test oracle problem from multiple perspectives. On the one hand, a test oracle must be defined for each instruction prompt, which is a complex and non-generalizable approach. On the other hand, current state-of-the-art oracles typically capture symbolic representations of the world (e.g., robot and object states), enabling the correctness evaluation of a task, but fail to assess other critical aspects, such as the quality with which VLA-enabled robots perform a task. In this paper, we explore whether Metamorphic Testing (MT) can alleviate the test oracle problem in this context. To do so, we propose two metamorphic relation patterns and five metamorphic relations to assess whether changes to the test inputs impact the original trajectory of the VLA-enabled robots. An empirical study involving five VLA models, two simulated robots, and four robotic tasks shows that MT can effectively alleviate the test oracle problem by automatically detecting diverse types of failures, including, but not limited to, uncompleted tasks. More importantly, the proposed MRs are generalizable, making the proposed approach applicable across different VLA models, robots, and tasks, even in the absence of test oracles.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Offering great potential in robotic manipulation, a capable Vision-Language-Action (VLA) foundation model is expected to faithfully generalize across tasks and platforms while ensuring cost efficiency (e.g., data and GPU hours required for adaptation). To this end, we develop LingBot-VLA with around 20,000 hours of real-world data from 9 popular dual-arm robot configurations. Through a systematic assessment on 3 robotic platforms, each completing 100 tasks with 130 post-training episodes per task, our model achieves clear superiority over competitors, showcasing its strong performance and broad generalizability. We have also built an efficient codebase, which delivers a throughput of 261 samples per second with an 8-GPU training setup, representing a 1.5~2.8$\times$ (depending on the relied VLM base model) speedup over existing VLA-oriented codebases. The above features ensure that our model is well-suited for real-world deployment. To advance the field of robot learning, we provide open access to the code, base model, and benchmark data, with a focus on enabling more challenging tasks and promoting sound evaluation standards.</div></details>

<div class="mono">The deployment of machine learning in high-stakes domains requires a balance between predictive safety and algorithmic fairness. However, existing fairness interventions often as- sume unconstrained resources and employ group-specific decision thresholds that violate anti- discrimination regulations. We introduce a post-hoc, model-agnostic threshold optimization framework that jointly balances safety, efficiency, and equity under strict and hard capacity constraints. To ensure legal compliance, the framework enforces a single, global decision thresh- old. We formulated a parameterized ethical loss function coupled with a bounded decision rule that mathematically prevents intervention volumes from exceeding the available resources. An- alytically, we prove the key properties of the deployed threshold, including local monotonicity with respect to ethical weighting and the formal identification of critical capacity regimes. We conducted extensive experimental evaluations on diverse high-stakes datasets. The principal re- sults demonstrate that capacity constraints dominate ethical priorities; the strict resource limit determines the final deployed threshold in over 80% of the tested configurations. Furthermore, under a restrictive 25% capacity limit, the proposed framework successfully maintains high risk identification (recall ranging from 0.409 to 0.702), whereas standard unconstrained fairness heuristics collapse to a near-zero utility. We conclude that theoretical fairness objectives must be explicitly subordinated to operational capacity limits to remain in deployment. By decou- pling predictive scoring from policy evaluation and strictly bounding intervention rates, this framework provides a practical and legally compliant mechanism for stakeholders to navigate unavoidable ethical trade-offs in resource-constrained environments.</div></details>

<div class="mono">We present, to our knowledge, the first sign language-driven Vision-Language-Action (VLA) framework for intuitive and inclusive human-robot interaction. Unlike conventional approaches that rely on gloss annotations as intermediate supervision, the proposed system adopts a gloss-free paradigm and directly maps visual sign gestures to semantic instructions. This design reduces annotation cost and avoids the information loss introduced by gloss representations, enabling more natural and scalable multimodal interaction.
  In this work, we focus on a real-time alphabet-level finger-spelling interface that provides a robust and low-latency communication channel for robotic control. Compared with large-scale continuous sign language recognition, alphabet-level interaction offers improved reliability, interpretability, and deployment feasibility in safety-critical embodied environments. The proposed pipeline transforms continuous gesture streams into coherent language commands through geometric normalization, temporal smoothing, and lexical refinement, ensuring stable and consistent interaction.
  Furthermore, the framework is designed to support future integration of transformer-based gloss-free sign language models, enabling scalable word-level and sentence-level semantic understanding. Experimental results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed system in grounding sign-derived instructions into precise robotic actions under diverse interaction scenarios. These results highlight the potential of the framework to advance accessible, scalable, and multimodal embodied intelligence.</div></details>

Although transfer learning models have shown promising detection accuracy, their reliability, computational feasibility, and interpretability in operational environments remain insufficiently explored. This study presents an explainability-aware empirical evaluation of seven pre-trained convolutional neural network architectures for multi-class IoT DDoS detection using the CICDDoS2019 dataset and an image-based traffic representation. The analysis integrates performance metrics, reliability-oriented statistics (MCC, Youden Index, confidence intervals), latency and training cost assessment, and interpretability evaluation using Grad-CAM and SHAP. Results indicate that DenseNet and MobileNet-based architectures achieve strong detection performance while demonstrating superior reliability and compact, class-consistent attribution patterns. DenseNet169 offers the strongest reliability and interpretability alignment, whereas MobileNetV3 provides an effective latency-accuracy trade-off for fog-level deployment.

<div class="mono">Floating-base multi-link robots can change their shape during flight, making them well-suited for applications in confined environments such as autonomous inspection and search and rescue. However, trajectory planning for such systems remains an open challenge because the problem lies in a high-dimensional, constraint-rich space where collision avoidance must be addressed together with kinematic limits and dynamic feasibility. This work introduces a hierarchical trajectory planning framework that integrates global guidance with configuration-aware local optimization. First, we exploit the dual nature of these robots - the root link as a rigid body for guidance and the articulated joints for flexibility - to generate global anchor states that decompose the planning problem into tractable segments. Second, we design a local trajectory planner that optimizes each segment in parallel with differentiable objectives and constraints, systematically enforcing kinematic feasibility and maintaining dynamic feasibility by avoiding control singularities. Third, we implement a complete system that directly processes point-cloud data, eliminating the need for handcrafted obstacle models. Extensive simulations and real-world experiments confirm that this framework enables an articulated aerial robot to exploit its morphology for maneuvering that rigid robots cannot achieve. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first planning framework for floating-base multi-link robots that has been demonstrated on a real robot to generate continuous, collision-free, and dynamically feasible trajectories directly from raw point-cloud inputs, without relying on handcrafted obstacle models.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Agile hardware design flows are a critically needed force multiplier to meet the exploding demand for compute. Recently, agentic generative AI systems have demonstrated significant advances in algorithm design, improving code efficiency, and enabling discovery across scientific domains.
  Bridging these worlds, we present ArchAgent, an automated computer architecture discovery system built on AlphaEvolve. We show ArchAgent&#x27;s ability to automatically design/implement state-of-the-art (SoTA) cache replacement policies (architecting new mechanisms/logic, not only changing parameters), broadly within the confines of an established cache replacement policy design competition.
  In two days without human intervention, ArchAgent generated a policy achieving a 5.3% IPC speedup improvement over the prior SoTA on public multi-core Google Workload Traces. On the heavily-explored single-core SPEC06 workloads, it generated a policy in just 18 days showing a 0.9% IPC speedup improvement over the existing SoTA (a similar &quot;winning margin&quot; as reported by the existing SoTA). ArchAgent achieved these gains 3-5x faster than prior human-developed SoTA policies.
  Agentic flows also enable &quot;post-silicon hyperspecialization&quot; where agents tune runtime-configurable parameters exposed in hardware policies to further align the policies with a specific workload (mix). Exploiting this, we demonstrate a 2.4% IPC speedup improvement over prior SoTA on SPEC06 workloads.
  Finally, we outline broader implications for computer architecture research in the era of agentic AI. For example, we demonstrate the phenomenon of &quot;simulator escapes&quot;, where the agentic AI flow discovered and exploited a loophole in a popular microarchitectural simulator - a consequence of the fact that these research tools were designed for a (now past) world where they were exclusively operated by humans acting in good-faith.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Quantum computing promises significant speed-ups for certain algorithms but the practical use of current noisy intermediate-scale quantum (NISQ) era computers remains limited by resources constraints (e.g., noise, qubits, gates, and circuit depth). Quantum circuit optimization is a key mitigation strategy. In this context, ZX-calculus has emerged as an alternative framework that allows for semantics-preserving quantum circuit optimization.
  We review ZX-based optimization of quantum circuits, categorizing them by optimization techniques, target metrics and intended quantum computing architecture. In addition, we outline critical challenges and future research directions, such as multi-objective optimization, scalable algorithms, and enhanced circuit extraction methods. This survey is valuable for researchers in both combinatorial optimization and quantum computing. For researchers in combinatorial optimization, we provide the background to understand a new challenging combinatorial problem: ZX-based quantum circuit optimization. For researchers in quantum computing, we classify and explain existing circuit optimization techniques.</div></details>

<div class="mono">With the continuous growth of neural network scales, low-precision quantization is widely used in edge accelerators. Classic multi-threshold activation hardware requires 2^n thresholds for n-bit outputs, causing a rapid increase in hardware cost as precision increases. We propose a reconfigurable activation hardware, GRAU, based on piecewise linear fitting, where the segment slopes are approximated by powers of two. Our design requires only basic comparators and 1-bit right shifters, supporting mixed-precision quantization and nonlinear functions such as SiLU. Compared with multi-threshold activators, GRAU reduces LUT consumption by over 90%, achieving higher hardware efficiency, flexibility, and scalability.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models are advancing autonomous driving by replacing modular pipelines with unified end-to-end architectures. However, current VLAs face two expensive requirements: (1) massive dataset collection, and (2) dense reasoning annotations. In this work, we address both challenges with NORD (No Reasoning for Driving). Compared to existing VLAs, NORD achieves competitive performance while being fine-tuned on &lt;60% of the data and no reasoning annotations, resulting in 3x fewer tokens. We identify that standard Group Relative Policy Optimization (GRPO) fails to yield significant improvements when applied to policies trained on such small, reasoning-free datasets. We show that this limitation stems from difficulty bias, which disproportionately penalizes reward signals from scenarios that produce high-variance rollouts within GRPO. NORD overcomes this by incorporating Dr. GRPO, a recent algorithm designed to mitigate difficulty bias in LLMs. As a result, NORD achieves competitive performance on Waymo and NAVSIM with a fraction of the training data and no reasoning overhead, enabling more efficient autonomous systems.

<div class="mono">Fine-grained spatio-temporal understanding is essential for video reasoning and embodied AI. Yet, while Multimodal Large Language Models (MLLMs) master static semantics, their grasp of temporal dynamics remains brittle. We present TimeBlind, a diagnostic benchmark for compositional spatio-temporal understanding. Inspired by cognitive science, TimeBlind categorizes fine-grained temporal understanding into three levels: recognizing atomic events, characterizing event properties, and reasoning about event interdependencies. Unlike benchmarks that conflate recognition with temporal reasoning, TimeBlind leverages a minimal-pairs paradigm: video pairs share identical static visual content but differ solely in temporal structure, utilizing complementary questions to neutralize language priors. Evaluating over 20 state-of-the-art MLLMs (e.g., GPT-5, Gemini 3 Pro) on 600 curated instances (2400 video-question pairs), reveals that the Instance Accuracy (correctly distinguishing both videos in a pair) of the best performing MLLM is only 48.2%, far below the human performance (98.2%). These results demonstrate that even frontier models rely heavily on static visual shortcuts rather than genuine temporal logic, positioning TimeBlind as a vital diagnostic tool for next-generation video understanding.

<div class="mono">Vision-language-action models must enable agents to execute long-horizon tasks under partial observability. However, most existing approaches remain observation-driven, relying on short context windows or repeated queries to vision-language models (VLMs). This leads to loss of task progress, action repetition under perceptual aliasing, and high inference latency. While semantic grounding is important, long-horizon manipulation fundamentally requires persistent, action-conditioned state representations. Current VLAs lack such representations and exhibit limited temporal and physical reasoning, making them ill-suited for multi-stage control. This paper introduces RB-VLA, a belief-centric architecture trained with self-supervised world-model objectives that maintains a compact latent state encoding task-relevant history, dynamics, and object interactions. Queried once per task, the VLM provides high-level intent, while the belief tracks task progress and enables phase-aware, causally grounded control under partial observability without storing raw observations or scaling memory with time. The belief and intent jointly condition a diffusion policy for robust closed-loop execution. RB-VLA outperforms prior VLAs on long-horizon benchmarks, achieving 52.5 percent and 37.5 percent higher success rates on multi-stage pick-and-place and stacking tasks, respectively, compared to pi_0. It also reduces inference latency by up to five times relative to baselines and eliminates memory growth across timesteps observed in existing VLAs. Ablations show the belief module is the primary driver of performance, increasing success rates from 32.5 percent without belief to 77.5 percent with belief.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Vision-language-action (VLA) models unify perception, language, and control for embodied agents but face significant challenges in practical deployment due to rapidly increasing compute and memory demands, especially as models scale to longer horizons and larger backbones. To address these bottlenecks, we introduce QuantVLA, a training-free post-training quantization (PTQ) framework that, to our knowledge, is the first PTQ approach for VLA systems and the first to successfully quantize a diffusion transformer (DiT) action head. QuantVLA incorporates three scale-calibrated components: (1) a selective quantization layout that integerizes all linear layers in both the language backbone and the DiT while keeping attention projections in floating point to preserve the original operator schedule; (2) attention temperature matching, a lightweight per-head scaling mechanism that stabilizes attention logits and is folded into the dequantization scales at inference; and (3) output head balancing, a per-layer residual interface calibration that mitigates post-projection energy drift. The framework requires no additional training, uses only a small unlabeled calibration buffer, and supports integer kernels for low-bit weights and activations while leaving the architecture unchanged. Across representative VLA models on LIBERO, QuantVLA exceeds the task success rates of full-precision baselines, achieves about 70% relative memory savings on the quantized components, and delivers a 1.22x speedup in end-to-end inference latency, providing a practical pathway toward scalable low-bit embodied intelligence under strict compute, memory, and power constraints.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Generative manipulation policies can fail catastrophically under deployment-time distribution shift, yet many failures are near-misses: the robot reaches almost-correct poses and would succeed with a small corrective motion. We present FlowCorrect, a deployment-time correction framework that converts near-miss failures into successes using sparse human nudges, without full policy retraining. During execution, a human provides brief corrective pose nudges via a lightweight VR interface. FlowCorrect uses these sparse corrections to locally adapt the policy, improving actions without retraining the backbone while preserving the model performance on previously learned scenarios. We evaluate on a real-world robot across three tabletop tasks: pick-and-place, pouring, and cup uprighting. With a low correction budget, FlowCorrect improves success on hard cases by 85\% while preserving performance on previously solved scenarios. The results demonstrate clearly that FlowCorrect learns only with very few demonstrations and enables fast and sample-efficient incremental, human-in-the-loop corrections of generative visuomotor policies at deployment time in real-world robotics.</div></details>

<div class="mono">Leveraging future observation modeling to facilitate action generation presents a promising avenue for enhancing the capabilities of Vision-Language-Action (VLA) models. However, existing approaches struggle to strike a balance between maintaining efficient, predictable future representations and preserving sufficient fine-grained information to guide precise action generation. To address this limitation, we propose WoG (World Guidance), a framework that maps future observations into compact conditions by injecting them into the action inference pipeline. The VLA is then trained to simultaneously predict these compressed conditions alongside future actions, thereby achieving effective world modeling within the condition space for action inference. We demonstrate that modeling and predicting this condition space not only facilitates fine-grained action generation but also exhibits superior generalization capabilities. Moreover, it learns effectively from substantial human manipulation videos. Extensive experiments across both simulation and real-world environments validate that our method significantly outperforms existing methods based on future prediction.
